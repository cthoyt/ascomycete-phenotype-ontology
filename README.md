## Ascomycete Phenotype Ontology

The repository contains the source for the APO

The OWL file can be built by running

    make 

On the command line (owltools required)

However, this step can be omitted for now as the OWL is currently
pulled from http://berkeleybop.org/ontologies/ which is updated
automatically.
